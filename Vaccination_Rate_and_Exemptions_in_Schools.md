## Vaccination Rate and Exemptions in Schools

**Project description:** This data set contains information from schools about vaccination rates and exemptions (0-100%) along with enrollment and school type. The objective of this research is to investigate the relationship between school type (public or private), enrollment, and the number of medical exemptions granted to students. By developing a linear regression model, the aim is to predict the number of medical exemptions in a school given its type and enrollment size. This model could potentially help policymakers and educators better understand the factors that contribute to medical exemptions and identify trends or discrepancies in the distribution of exemptions across different school types and sizes. A hypothesis test is also ran to detemerine how do the odds of students claiming a religious exemption to vaccination increase or decrease with public school status?

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

* Ho: There is no linear relationship and difference between the variables.
* Ha: There is a linear relationship and difference between the variables.

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
